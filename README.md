# Image_Gallery

This project captures an image gallery that has a main cover or thumbnail image that is the one picture actually selected for maximized view and a row of other available images in the gallery that can be viewed. The styling for the other images that are not selected is done to give it a better look and feel. Moreover, navigation buttons(arrows in this project) are added in order to switch from one maximized image to the other upcoming or move to the previous image present in sequence. External CSS and JS are used in this project.
